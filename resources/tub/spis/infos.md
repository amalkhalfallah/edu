# Informations about the presentation

Consists in a 30mn detailed presentation about the paper, followed by questions about the paper and the course.

The topic is the **compound wiretap channel**, described in [this paper](./paper.pdf).

Teacher's guidelines:
> A possible topic could be wiretap channel under channel uncertainty. I attached a paper that I wrote some time ago reviewing this topic. One suggestion would be to review the “Compound Wiretap Channel”. In the lecture, we only talked about the perfect CSI (Channel state information) case, where the channel is known to everyone. Compound channel is an uncertainty model. So, you could present this compound model (how is it defined and how is the uncertainty modeled?) then you could present the compound wiretap channel, i.e., the secure version of it. Do we know capacity in this case? If yes, in which cases? Can you make sense out of the rate expressions?
